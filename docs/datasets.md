# The datasets

## MNIST, end to end

`xrddatasets.mnist` is the worked example: it fetches the handwritten digits —
through this library, so the source can be a URL, a path or bytes already in
hand — and writes them as one tree per class. It is one of the eight in
[`xrddatasets`](#the-datasets-everyone-teaches-with) under its own name,
because it is the one everybody starts with.

```python
from xrdroot import create, mnist

with create("mnist.root") as f:
    for split in ("train", "test"):
        print(mnist.convert(f, split=split))
# {'train_0': 5923, 'train_1': 6742, ... 'train_9': 5949}
# {'test_0': 980, 'test_1': 1135, ... 'test_9': 1009}
```

That is all 70,000 images in one 11.6 MB file — as small as the gzipped
originals, and unlike them addressable a range at a time. Each tree holds
`image` (784 `uint8`, the 28×28 picture flat), `label`, and `index`, the
entry's place in the original file, so any row can be traced back. One tree
per digit is the shape a training loop wants: sampling a class reads one part
of the file rather than seeking all over it, and every tree carries its label
anyway, so concatenating all ten and shuffling works exactly as well.

Training on it is the loader from [above](#into-pytorch-and-tensorflow), with
nothing in between:

```python
import torch, xrdroot, xrdml.tensors

with xrdroot.open_root("mnist.root") as f:
    loaders = [
        torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
            xrdml.tensors.dataset(f[f"train_{digit}"], ["image", "label"], step=64),
            batch_size=None,
        )
        for digit in range(10)
    ]
    for parts in zip(*loaders):  # 64 of each digit: a balanced batch
        x = torch.cat([part["image"] for part in parts]).float().div_(255)
        y = torch.cat([part["label"] for part in parts]).long()
        loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(model(x.view(-1, 1, 28, 28)), y)
```

The `image` column arrives shaped `(entries, 784)` because the file says it is
784 wide, so that `view` is the only shaping anybody has to write. Taking one
batch from each loader is what the per-class layout buys: every batch is class
balanced without a sampler, and the epoch ends with the smallest class.
Training on the ten trees as one stream instead is `itertools.chain`, and
shuffling across them is whatever your training would do anyway.

Point `open_root` at a `root://` or `https://` URL and the same loop trains
straight off a storage element, reading the baskets it needs and nothing else.

## The datasets everyone teaches with

MNIST is one of 1,422 datasets admitted to a public mirror. Two more registered
sets below the source ceiling are available for private builds but have no
formal redistribution licence. `xrddatasets` converts
the sets machine learning is actually taught and benchmarked with, all of them
the same way — one tree per class, the label beside the data, and the row's
place in the original file so any number can be traced back to where it came
from. Of the original 627, three hundred and fifty have a number to predict rather
than a class to sort into get one tree of every row instead, and the number to
predict is a column like any other. What ships here is the converter, not the
data: no dataset is redistributed in this repository, and `datasets/` is where
the files it writes are meant to go.

```python
from xrdroot import datasets

datasets.convert("cifar10", "cifar10.root", split="train")
# {'train_airplane': 5000, 'train_automobile': 5000, ... 'train_truck': 5000}

datasets.convert("iris", "iris.root")
# {'setosa': 50, 'versicolor': 50, 'virginica': 50}
```

`describe()` prints the lot, with the licence and the source of each:

Three hundred and fifty of this hand-curated shelf have a number to predict
rather than a class; the rest sort rows into classes. The last column is one file holding
every split, written with the default `zlib`, as measured on a conversion of
the original 627 public sets — every split of a set that has them, a
tree a class, and the `about` key beside them.

The last four hundred come from two places that publish whole shelves at once.
The R teaching tables are read from the CSV Rdatasets serves for each: a
header row naming the columns the way the R package documents them, a first
column of row names, then a row per example. A row-name column that counts
from one is kept as `row`, and one that names the thing measured — a car, a
canton, a state — is kept as `name`; what each may be passed on under is what
its package says, which is why the GPL, the LGPL, the Artistic licence, MIT
and CC0 all appear. The country-year tables are the CSV behind an Our World in
Data chart: a place, its three-letter code where it has one — a continent or
an income group has none — the year, and the one thing measured, which is the
number to predict.

The second two hundred are the same two shelves read further along. From R
come the tables the history of statistics was written from — Arbuthnot's
christenings, Cavendish weighing the earth, Snow's cholera deaths, Galton on
parents and children, Nightingale's mortality of the army, the Prussian horse
kicks — the trials medicine is taught with, what archaeologists dig up and
measure, the quartets built to show that a summary hides the shape of a thing,
and the series forecasting is practised on. A survey question nobody answered
is kept as a class of its own rather than dropped, so `bakeoff_challenges`
sorts a baker into `not_recorded` and `geologic_time_scale` into `unranked`.
A column named after something Python already uses is renamed out of the way:
the German health survey's `self` is written as `self_`. From Our World in
Data come what the world burns and generates, what it lets into the air, how
warm the air and the sea have grown, what the land is put to and what it
yields, and how many people live off it; where a chart measures a band as well
as a value — the temperature anomaly and its low and high — the value is the
number to predict and the band is carried beside it.

Another 499 entries are generated from explicitly licensed, public Hugging
Face dataset repositories with complete scalar Parquet conversions. They add
805 bounded output splits from 1,235 shards and 12.13 GB of source data; 24 expose a
published `ClassLabel`, while 475 expose a named or explicitly designated
numeric teaching target. Every scalar source field is retained. Text becomes
fixed-width UTF-8 bytes with a companion length, missing floats become NaN,
`ClassLabel` metadata becomes an integer, and one `rows` TTree is written per
official split. The crowd-code corpus is additionally partitioned by power-of-two
UTF-8 text length so outlier source rows cannot force a multi-gigabyte fixed-width
ROOT file. The generated [selection manifest](https://github.com/rob-c/PyXRootDClient/blob/main/catalogues/hub-open.json)
records every repository, revision, canonical licence URL, source size and
split. Ambiguous `public` metadata, gated repositories, incomplete conversions
and nested schemas are rejected rather than guessed.

Seventy default large archives use disk-backed readers rather than putting
their sources wholesale into memory. This behavior is independent of origin:
EMNIST and both CIFAR archives use the same retained source cache as UCI, JetNet,
OmniFold Big, TinySOL, WikiText-103, ReefSet, BioDCASE and BirdSet, alongside
37 members of the Hub shelf. A dataset's
complete unique source
payload must be at least 100 MB and strictly below 2,000,000,000 bytes for
`--large` by default; `convert` enforces the same ceiling when it fetches the
declared source. `--allow-oversize` (alias `--no-size-limit`) removes the upper
source-selection bound for registered converters, as does
`convert(..., allow_oversize=True)` in Python. Exact published source-size
checks remain in force. Explicit local `parts=` remain available for converter
tests and private data without claiming them as catalogue downloads.

| name | retained conversion | compressed source |
|---|---|---:|
| `emnist` | selected IDX members are decoded per official split; pixels are unchanged | 535.7 MiB |
| `cifar10` | binary RGB planes and official train/test split are preserved | 162.2 MiB |
| `cifar100` | binary RGB planes, fine labels, coarse labels and official split are preserved | 160.7 MiB |

The UCI archives below the ceiling have purpose-built streaming readers:

| name | ROOT rows | compressed source |
|---|---|---:|
| `susy` | 5,000,000 collision events, official last-500,000 test split | 879.6 MiB |
| `multimodal_damage` | 640×640 RGB images paired with their captions | 1.05 GiB |
| `pems_sf` | one 963×144 occupancy matrix per day, official train/test split | 104.4 MiB |
| `physical_unclonable_functions` | 64- and 128-bit challenges in four official partitions | 152.4 MiB |

| `twin_gas_sensor_arrays` | padded ten-minute, eight-channel exposure records | 194.6 MiB |
| `electricity_load_diagrams` | quarter-hour loads for all 370 clients | 249.2 MiB |
| `opportunity_activity` | raw sensor timestamps and locomotion labels | 292.4 MiB |
| `gas_sensor_dynamic_mixtures` | concentrations and 16 raw sensor channels | 351.9 MiB |
| `p53_mutants` | 5,408 molecular features and activity label | 527.0 MiB |
| `pamap2` | timestamps, 52 measurements and activity labels | 656.3 MiB |
| `hhar` | heterogeneous phone/watch motion rows | 784.0 MiB |
| `year_prediction_msd` | 90 timbre statistics and release year, official train/test split | 201.2 MiB |

Fifty-four more explicitly licensed archive families are admitted: JetNet (five
HDF5 shards, 436.5 MB total), OmniFold Big (817.9 MB), TinySOL (1.03 GB),
WikiText-103 (313.1 MB), ReefSet (1.63 GB), BioDCASE 2025 Task 3 (224.7 MB),
Speech Commands v0.01 (1.49 GB), AudioMNIST (1.91 GB through its fixed
Hugging Face mirror), CirCor heart sounds (471.3 MB), BirdSet BASEAL
(225.2 MB), UAV Maize Stress (1.18 GB), Wildlife MNIST (1.48 GB), SODv2
(14.5 MB), All-Sky Cloud Segmentation Almeria (16.8 MB), 17 CC BY MedMNIST
28-pixel classification/volume sources (686.0 MB together), Galaxy10 SDSS
(210.2 MB), Mars Surface Image v1 (60.6 MB), and SWEFil (151.5 MB).

The condensed-matter shelf contributes 20 individually buildable problems. Seven are
image-first collections, and every source remains below the strict two-gigabyte ceiling:

| name | ROOT representation | compressed source |
|---|---|---:|
| `jarvis_stm_bravais` | paired positive/negative-bias RGB STM images; five Bravais TTrees | 313.9 MB |
| `nffa_sem_compact` | grayscale SEM images; five nanomaterial-morphology TTrees | 1.97 GB |
| `moke_skyrmion_segmentation` | MOKE intensity image plus background/skyrmion/defect mask | 957.2 MB |
| `wse2_stm_defects` | float32 atomic STM patch plus three-class defect mask and author split | 1.79 GB |
| `tem_nanoparticle_morphology` | grayscale TEM images; three balanced assembly TTrees | 1.57 GB |
| `polymer_blend_afm` | five aligned, unnormalised float32 AFM channels | 483.8 MB |
| `perovskite_sem_segmentation` | RGB SEM image plus rasterized phase/defect mask, retaining image/annotation geometry | 77.1 MB |

The other 13 are the complete Matbench v0.1 task suite: `matbench_dielectric`,
`matbench_expt_gap`, `matbench_expt_is_metal`, `matbench_glass`,
`matbench_jdft2d`, `matbench_log_gvrh`, `matbench_log_kvrh`,
`matbench_mp_e_form`, `matbench_mp_gap`, `matbench_mp_is_metal`,
`matbench_perovskites`, `matbench_phonons`, and `matbench_steels`. Composition
tasks retain the formula and add a normalized 8×16 elemental image. Structure tasks
also retain the 3×3 lattice and every site/species occupancy, plus three 32×32
fractional-coordinate projections. The Matbench gzip JSON is streamed row by row.

The JARVIS visual-physics shelf adds another 100 independently buildable
regression problems: 50 from the 93,902-crystal JARVIS-DFT 3D snapshot and the
same 50 concepts from the 1,103-crystal JARVIS-DFT 2D snapshot. They are the
Cartesian product of these source prefixes and target groups:

| name prefix | logical tasks | pinned compressed source | canonical record |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `jarvis_dft3d_` | 50 | 48.45 MB | [JARVIS-DFT 3D](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6815699.v11) |
| `jarvis_dft2d_` | 50 | 8.39 MB | [JARVIS-DFT 2D](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6815705.v8) |

Thirty-two targets preserve published calculated observables: formation and
total energies, OptB88vdW/MBJ gaps, density, energy above hull, cutoff and
k-point parameters, atom count, two magnetic moments, six dielectric-axis
responses, electron/hole effective mass, two band-difference measures, eight
n/p thermoelectric quantities, SLME, spin-orbit spillage and exfoliation
energy. Eighteen transparent teaching targets are derived from the published
structure: lattice lengths and angles, volume, volume per atom, length/angle
statistics, anisotropy, element count and atomic-number statistics.

Every task retains the JARVIS id, formula, lattice, padded atomic numbers and
fractional positions. It also supplies a normalized 8×16 elemental image and
three 32×32 orthogonal crystal projections. Numeric-id modulo ten provides a
stable 80/10/10 train/validation/test tree partition; this project-created
partition is stated on every generated detail page. The two input ZIPs have
shared cache names, so building all 100 tasks downloads 56.84 MB once rather
than downloading the same structures 100 times. The task files intentionally
repeat the input representation so each `.root` remains independently usable:

```console
$ xrd-datasets build /nfs/datasets --only 'jarvis_dft*' \
    --source-cache /nfs/dataset-sources --jobs 4
```

The Alex-MP-20 shelf adds another 100 visual materials-physics regressions over
675,204 inorganic structures and preserves OMatG's train/validation/test split.
Its 197.51 MB of CC BY 4.0 Parquet shards are shared in the source cache by all
tasks. Six targets are published observables, 32 are documented cell and
aggregate-composition derivations, and 62 are elemental stoichiometric fractions.
Every row retains the cell, padded atoms and source identifiers together with a
normalized 8×16 elemental image, an occupancy-only three-plane image and three
atomic-number 32×32 crystal projections:

```console
$ xrd-datasets build /nfs/datasets --only 'alex_mp20_*' \
    --source-cache /nfs/dataset-sources --jobs 2
```

For an elemental-fraction exercise, choose `occupancy_projection` as the model
input instead of `atomic_numbers`, `element_image` or `projection`; the latter
branches deliberately retain exact composition for provenance and would leak
that target. The canonical MatterGen paper, the OMatG repository and the
Alexandria source collection are linked from every generated detail page.

The `well_*` shelf adds 100 visual field-learning tasks from sixteen distinct
CC BY 4.0 repositories in [The Well](https://polymathic-ai.org/the_well/).
Its domains include acoustic and Helmholtz waves, active matter,
reaction-diffusion, planetary atmospheres, convection, hydrodynamic
instabilities, non-Newtonian flow, plasma mixing and stellar/relativistic
astrophysics. Six common tasks per source predict the next state, temporal
change, gradient magnitude, Laplacian, an above-mean mask and next-state mean;
four sources add RMS regression.

Each entry is a traceable 64×64 central plane containing raw and min-max
normalized input values, validity masks, a transformed target image, scalar
target, source field name and original limits. Sixteen pinned HDF5 objects are
shared across the 100 outputs. Eight are admitted by the default ceiling; the
complete 86.52 GB physical source shelf needs the explicit production opt-in:

```console
$ xrd-datasets build /nfs/datasets --only 'well_*' --allow-oversize \
    --source-cache /nfs/dataset-sources --jobs 1
```

This is deliberately an educational slice, not a claim to mirror The Well's
full 15 TB. Every detail page links the domain-specific documentation and
paper, identifies the selected upstream test shard, and states the derived
contiguous temporal split.

[`xrdml.load_image_2d`](https://github.com/rob-c/xrdml/blob/main/docs/ml.md#raw-and-normalized-2d-crystal-images) reads one
entry and reconstructs any `xy`, `xz` or `yz` plane as both its raw
atomic-number image and a normalized floating-point image. Its optional plot
puts the two side by side; `examples/jarvis_2d_visualize.py` can display or
save the result directly from a local path, hosted URL or catalogue name.

Wildlife MNIST's float32 RGB arrays remain channel-first and at their
published scale; its official non-mixed training and mixed test labels become
digit, background and foreground branches under split-and-digit TTrees. The maize converter
joins four ZIP shards, writes the water and rust source orthomosaics as padded
224×224 six-band tiles, casts the published float16 derived patches to float32,
and keeps their five-class masks and coordinates in separate source/patch TTrees.
All 229 default large registrations total 93.70 GB when logical task sources are
summed; the public build withholds the two unlicensed CIFAR sources and reports
93.36 GB. Shared cache names reduce the physical source fetch to about
41.15 GB. Sources are cached on disk and read a member or record at a time; allow 500 GiB for the
source cache, expanding output, temporary nested members and writer baskets
on a first complete pass. JetNet's HDF5 and the multimodal archive's JPEG
formats use optional readers, as does WikiText-103's Parquet source:

The explicit oversized selection adds eight UCI archives, all with
purpose-built, bounded-source readers:

| name | retained conversion | compressed source |
|---|---|---:|
| `higgs` | float32 collision features; official train/test boundary; signal/background TTrees | 2.82 GB |
| `realdisp` | timestamps, subject/placement metadata and 117 sensor readings; activity TTrees | 2.67 GB |
| `cuffless_blood_pressure` | HDF5 PPG, pressure and ECG signals in length-preserving 1,000-sample windows | 3.36 GB |
| `ppg_dalia` | synchronized wrist signals in overlapping eight-second windows with subject and heart-rate target | 2.87 GB |
| `medical_deepfakes` | original signed 512×512 DICOM pixels, calibration and tamper labels | 6.40 GB |
| `gas_sensor_arrays_open_sampling` | controls and 72 sensor series padded with their true lengths; chemical TTrees | 8.37 GB |
| `hepmass` | all six gzip CSV files; three hypotheses and their official train/test splits | 7.89 GB |
| `chipseq` | run-length bedGraph coverage split at published weak-label boundaries; label TTrees | 37.28 GB |

Together the default and oversized selections are 287 registered converters
and 681.39 GB of declared logical source payload (285 and 681.05 GB in the public build,
which still withholds CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). Start an oversized production
pass with one conversion job and at least 1 TiB of working space. Shared-cache
deduplication reduces the actual source fetch to about 193.10 GB; ROOT output
and temporary space must still be measured on the production filesystem.

```console
$ pip install 'pyxrootdclient[datasets]'
```

Nothing is redistributed here. Each set is fetched from whoever publishes it,
on the machine doing the converting, and the licences above are what those
publishers say — read them before passing the converted file on. The CIFAR
sets have no formal licence at all; Krizhevsky asks that the tech report be
cited. So that a file outlives the program that made it, `convert` writes an
`about` key beside the trees holding the same statement:

```python
with xrdroot.open_root("cifar10.root") as f:
    print(f["train_about"])
# CIFAR-10: 60,000 photographs, 32x32 colour, 10 classes
# split: train
# licence: no formal licence; Krizhevsky asks that the tech report be cited
# source: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
# transformation: extracted the publisher's binary records; preserved 32x32
# RGB-plane unsigned-byte pixels, labels and official train/test split without
# normalization or augmentation; wrote one ROOT TTree per class
# layout: one tree per class
```

The CIFAR sets are taken in their **binary** distribution rather than the
Python one, on purpose: that Python distribution is a pickle. The ordinary
archive readers — IDX, tar, zip, a zip inside a zip, gzip, WAV, ARFF, CSV and
the XML a spreadsheet keeps inside its own zip — use the standard library.
PPG-DaLiA itself publishes NumPy arrays in a pickle; its large reader uses a
restricted unpickler that permits only NumPy's inert array constructors and
built-in containers, never an arbitrary class or callable from the download.

A table that gives its names in a header takes them from the first line that is
neither blank nor a comment, because a file is as likely to name its columns
after a preamble as before one. A column of dates holds the days since 1970; a
column of timestamps holds the seconds, so a set recorded every quarter of an
hour — `occupancy`, `steel_industry` — keeps its clock rather than collapsing
onto the day it was taken. Either way a missing value is `-1`.

Images come out exactly as the archive laid them: CIFAR is 3072 bytes an
entry, 1024 red then 1024 green then 1024 blue, which is what PyTorch wants,
so the loop is the MNIST one with a wider `view`:

```python
loaders = [
    torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        xrdml.tensors.dataset(f[f"train_{cls}"], ["image", "label"], step=64),
        batch_size=None,
    )
    for cls in (
        "airplane",
        "automobile",
        "bird",
        "cat",
        "deer",
        "dog",
        "frog",
        "horse",
        "ship",
        "truck",
    )
]
for parts in zip(*loaders):
    x = torch.cat([part["image"] for part in parts]).float().div_(255)
    loss = criterion(model(x.view(-1, 3, 32, 32)), ...)
```

EMNIST is MNIST's shape — 28×28 IDX, the same reader — but NIST wrote its
images with the rows and the columns swapped, and they are kept that way here
rather than quietly turned round. Measure a `1` and you can see it: in MNIST
the ink runs down rows 4–24 and across columns 9–19, in EMNIST down rows 9–19
and across columns 3–25. Each tree says so in its title, so a `view(28, 28)`
that comes out sideways has an answer in the file itself:

```python
x = torch.from_numpy(...).view(-1, 28, 28).transpose(1, 2)  # if you want it upright
```

The set converted is the **balanced** split, 47 classes: the ten digits, the
26 capitals, and the eleven lower-case letters whose shape differs from the
capital — `a b d e f g h n q r t`. The other fifteen were merged into their
capitals by NIST because nothing in a 28×28 bitmap tells `c` from `C`.

## Detection and pixel masks

Twenty-two open sources now provide visual problems tied directly to astronomy,
planetary and atmospheric physics, microscopy and medical imaging. The latest
20 are the 17 redistributable MedMNIST subsets plus Galaxy10 SDSS, the Curiosity
rover collection and SWEFil; DermaMNIST is deliberately absent because its
CC BY-NC terms do not permit the public mirror.

| name | task retained in ROOT | complete source |
|---|---|---:|
| `pathmnist`, `chestmnist`, `octmnist`, `pneumoniamnist`, `retinamnist`, `breastmnist`, `bloodmnist`, `tissuemnist` | compact histology, radiography, OCT, ultrasound and microscopy image tasks with official splits | 511,802,078 B total |
| `organamnist`, `organcmnist`, `organsmnist` | axial, coronal and sagittal CT organ classification | 70,302,478 B total |
| `organmnist3d`, `nodulemnist3d`, `adrenalmnist3d`, `fracturemnist3d`, `vesselmnist3d`, `synapsemnist3d` | 9,996 compact 28³ CT, vessel, shape-mask and electron-microscopy volumes | 103,944,897 B total |
| `galaxy10_sdss` | 21,785 69×69 SDSS/Galaxy Zoo morphology examples in ten classes | 210,234,548 B |
| `mars_surface_images` | 6,691 roughly 256-pixel Curiosity images in publisher train/validation/test splits | 60,635,475 B |
| `swefil` | 554 raw/processed H-alpha images, 4,144 COCO boxes and four overlap-preserving masks | 151,465,835 B |
| `sodv2` | 600 simulated orbital scenes, 1,339 normalized YOLO boxes, official train/validation split and near/mid/far distance TTrees | 14,516,386 B |
| `allsky_cloud_segmentation` | 818 all-sky images paired with unchanged five-class masks, official train/validation/test split and four-camera test set | 16,828,503 B |

Every MedMNIST file keeps its published 28×28 or 28×28×28 uint8 tensor with no
new scaling and preserves `train`, `validation` and `test`. Single-label tasks
write one TTree per class; ChestMNIST writes one `samples` tree with its
fourteen-wide binary `targets` vector. The NPZ members are safely extracted and
memory-mapped, so TissueMNIST's 236,386 cells do not become one Python-memory
copy. The generated pages credit the eight MedMNIST creators, link the versioned
Zenodo origin and licence, and cite the dataset paper.

Galaxy10 keeps the publisher's complete HDF5 array as 69×69×3 uint8 pixels and
the ten Galaxy Zoo morphology labels; no unofficial split is invented. Mars
converts its small grayscale subset to RGB and letterboxes variable source
geometry within 256×256 while retaining source dimensions, padding, sol,
instrument and product id. Its 25 published category ids become TTrees, with
the unused `sun` id correctly left empty because the official manifests contain
24 populated categories.

SWEFil is the requested real solar-physics detection and masking problem. Each
2048×2048 GONG JPEG is resized to 512×512 RGB; every COCO polygon is rasterized
into separate QRF, IRF, ARF and sunspot masks, so overlaps are not erased.
Forty normalized source boxes, category ids, source areas and annotation ids
are padded beside a true `objects` count. Separate `processed` and `raw` TTrees
retain the official train/test division and observatory/timestamp identity.

SODv2's `image` is a channel-last `794×706×3` uint8 row. `boxes` is a
16×4 float32 tensor in the source's normalized `(centre_x, centre_y, width,
height)` convention; `objects` says how many rows are real, and the unused
tail is zero-padded. `object_labels` is zero for each satellite and `-1` in
the padding. Trees retain the publisher's three observation-distance strata,
for example `train_mid_0_5_to_2_km`.

The all-sky `image` is channel-last `512×512×3` uint8 and `mask` is a
`512×512` uint8 semantic map. Values remain exactly the publisher's `0`
camera mask, `1` sky, `2` low cloud, `3` mid cloud and `4` high cloud.
`class_fractions`, camera id, acquisition timestamp and camera coordinates sit
beside each pair. The source's validation CSV defines the 616/154 training and
validation partition; the 48-row test tree keeps 12 observations from each of
four independent imagers.

```console
$ python -m pip install 'pyxrootdclient[datasets]'
$ xrd-datasets build /nfs/datasets \
    --only swefil --only galaxy10_sdss --only mars_surface_images \
    --only pathmnist --only organmnist3d \
    --source-cache /nfs/dataset-sources --jobs 1
$ xrd-datasets verify /nfs/datasets
```

No synthetic mask or box is inferred during conversion: JPEG/PNG pixels are
decoded to model-ready unsigned bytes, annotations are joined by filename and
their coordinate or class convention is kept. The ROOT file's `about` key and
the generated site credit the creators and publisher, link the canonical
record or repository and state this transformation.

Sound is the same idea with a longer row. Every raw-audio converter decodes
signed 16-bit PCM to float32 in `[-1, 1)` before writing it; models therefore
receive waveform values directly rather than compressed audio bytes or integer
amplitudes. `fsdd` is 3,000 WAV recordings read
with the standard library's `wave`, and because a tree column is a fixed size,
every clip is written into a 20,000-sample column — 2.5 seconds at 8 kHz — with
a `length` beside it saying how much of that is recording and how much is the
zeroes after it. A clip longer than the column is refused by name rather than
truncated, and so is a file that is not 8 kHz mono 16-bit, which is what
`speaker` being a column can be trusted against. Its publisher's repetition
rule becomes `train_0` … `train_9` and `test_0` … `test_9` trees:

```python
with xrdroot.open_root("fsdd.root") as f:
    for batch in xrdml.tensors.iter_tensors(f["train_7"], ["audio", "length", "speaker"], step=32):
        wave = batch["audio"]  # float32, already normalized to [-1, 1)
        mask = torch.arange(20000) < batch["length"][:, None]
        loss = criterion(model(wave * mask), ...)
```

The other waveform sets exercise different teaching problems while remaining
below the default two-gigabyte source ceiling:

| name | waveform layout in ROOT | source payload |
|---|---|---:|
| `speech_commands_v001` | 16,000 float32 values, official train/validation/test lists, 30 words plus one-second noise windows | 1.489 GB |
| `audiomnist` | 48,000 float32 values with speaker, repetition, age, sex, accent and origin metadata | 1.907 GB |
| `circor_heart_sound` | non-overlapping five-second 4 kHz windows with patient, auscultation, murmur and outcome labels | 471.3 MB |
| `tinysol` | lossless ten-second chunks per orchestral note, one tree per instrument | 1.027 GB |
| `reefset` | 30,720 values plus the source's acoustic and recorder provenance | 1.629 GB |
| `biodcase_2025_task3` | up to 32,000 values with the official training/validation split | 224.7 MB |

TinySOL's publisher describes clips as two to ten seconds, but the distributed
archive contains longer valid PCM recordings. The converter never truncates
them: `recording` identifies the original WAV, `recording_length` preserves its
total frame count, and `chunk`, `chunks`, and `length` describe the contiguous
ten-second ROOT rows needed to reconstruct it exactly.

Build only the waveform shelf with one conversion job so archive inflation and
ROOT compression do not compete for the same disk:

```console
$ xrd-datasets build /nfs/datasets \
    --only fsdd --only speech_commands_v001 --only audiomnist \
    --only circor_heart_sound --only tinysol --only reefset \
    --only biodcase_2025_task3 \
    --source-cache /nfs/dataset-sources --jobs 1
$ xrd-datasets verify /nfs/datasets
```

AudioMNIST is only 92,968,703 bytes below the strict two-gigabyte source
ceiling and its decoded 48 kHz float rows can occupy several gigabytes before
ROOT compression. Keep both the source cache and output on the production NFS
mount for this pass.

AudioMNIST is the useful mirror example: `origin` names the authors' GitHub
project, while `source`, `repository`, and `mirrors` identify the fixed
Hugging Face adaptation that supplies the three registered archives. Those
roles are separate in `index.json`, the generated HTML, JSON-LD, and each
ROOT file's `about` key.

Some sets are neither pictures nor a table of named fields, but one long row
of numbers an example — and those become one fixed-size column called
`features`, which is what a training loop wants of 561 of them and what
`iter_tensors` hands straight to a tensor. The awkward part of those sets is
never the numbers, it is where the publisher put the labels, so all three
places are read:

```python
datasets.convert("miniboone", "miniboone.root")
# {'electron_neutrino': 36499, 'muon_neutrino': 93565}
```

`miniboone` is the one to point at when somebody says HEP formats are not for
machine learning: it is a particle-identification set from a neutrino
experiment, published for exactly this teaching purpose, and it goes back into
a ROOT file where it started. Its file has no labels in it at all — the first
line says `36499 93565`, meaning the first 36,499 rows are signal and the rest
background — so the label comes from where a row lies, and a file with more
rows than the counts promised is refused rather than labelled by guesswork.

`har` keeps its labels in a file beside the numbers, inside a zip inside the
zip, with the volunteer's number in a third file; all three are read together
and a mismatch between their lengths is an error, not a silent truncation.
`semeion` writes its label as ten columns at the end of each row, one of them
set — anything other than exactly one set is refused. Its 256 pixels are 16×16
black and white, so it reads like a smaller MNIST:

```python
with xrdroot.open_root("semeion.root") as f:
    row = f["3"]["image"].array(0, 1)
    for line in range(16):
        print("".join("#" if pixel else "." for pixel in row[line * 16 : line * 16 + 16]))
```

Text works the way sound does. `sms_spam` is 5,574 messages, and since a tree
column is a fixed size each one is written into 1,024 bytes of UTF-8 with a
`message_length` beside it saying where the real text stops:

```python
with xrdroot.open_root("sms_spam.root") as f:
    tree = f["spam"]
    held, upto = bytes(tree["message"].array(0, 1)), tree["message_length"].array(0, 1)[0]
    print(held[:upto].decode())
# Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup final tkts 21st May 2005. ...
```

That file is tab-separated, and reading it as an ordinary CSV would quietly
change 536 of its messages and lose two rows entirely, because a message that
opens with a quotation mark swallows everything up to the next one. English
means its quotes literally, so `Table` sets `quoted=False` and the text
arrives as written.

The tabular sets become one column per field instead of one wide array:

```python
with xrdroot.open_root("penguins.root") as f:
    print(xrdml.tensors.numeric(f["gentoo"]))
# ['island', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm',
#  'body_mass_g', 'sex', 'year', 'label', 'index']
```

Trees hold numbers, so the categories are numbered: `datasets.DATASETS[
"penguins"].codes` says which is which, and a category nobody declared is
refused rather than guessed at. A measurement nobody took becomes a NaN, which
is what every reader downstream already means by it; a category nobody
recorded becomes `-1`, because there is no such code.

Not every set has classes. Half of what regression is taught with is a table
with a number at the end of the row — the miles a car did on a gallon, the
bicycles hired in an hour, the mark a pupil finished on — and forcing that into
classes would be inventing bins nobody published. A set with no `classes` has a
`"target"` field instead of a `"label"` one, and it comes out as a single tree
called `rows`, with the number to predict a `double` column beside the features:

```python
datasets.convert("auto_mpg", "auto_mpg.root")
# {'rows': 398}

with xrdroot.open_root("auto_mpg.root") as f:
    print(xrdml.tensors.numeric(f["rows"]))
# ['mpg', 'cylinders', 'displacement', 'horsepower', 'weight',
#  'acceleration', 'model_year', 'origin', 'car_name_length', 'index']
```

There is no `label` column in those files, because there is nothing for it to
say, and `describe()` says `no classes, a number to predict` where it would
otherwise count them. `energy_efficiency` has two targets rather than one — a
building's heating load and its cooling load — which is nothing special here:
they are two columns.

`auto_mpg` also shows the older way of ending a row. Its eight numbers are
separated by runs of spaces and then, after a tab, the car is named in quotes:
`18.0 8 307.0 130.0 3504. 12.0 70 1  "chevrolet chevelle malibu"`. Splitting
that on whitespace turns one name into three fields, so `tail=` says how many
fields the line really has; the line is split that many times and no further,
and the name arrives in a `car_name` column with a `car_name_length` beside it
the way any text does.

Dates are a column too. `bike_sharing` is a time series — a count of hires an
hour for two years — and a `"date"` field becomes the days since 1970 as an
`int`, which sorts, subtracts and plots without a parser at the other end:

```python
import datetime

with xrdroot.open_root("bike_sharing.root") as f:
    day = f["rows"]["date"].array(0, 1)[0]
    print(datetime.date(1970, 1, 1) + datetime.timedelta(days=day))
# 2011-01-01
```

`dates=` says how the file writes them, in `strptime` terms, and a date written
some other way is refused with that format quoted back rather than guessed at.

Two of these sets are published only as spreadsheets, so `read_xlsx` reads one.
A modern spreadsheet is a zip of XML with the text kept once in a shared table
and referred to by number, which is why a sheet on its own reads as nonsense
and this does not — and it needs nothing that is not already in the standard
library. Rows of nothing at all, and the empty cells trailing a row, are not
data and are dropped; a gap in the middle of a row is kept, so the fields after
it still line up:

```python
datasets.convert("energy_efficiency", "energy.root")
# {'rows': 768}
```

Tables do not all arrive as comma-separated files, so `Table` says which shape
it is and the reader does the rest: `delimiter=None` splits on whitespace
(`seeds`), `delimiter=";"` with `header=True` reads the shape a spreadsheet
exports (`wine_quality`), `comment=` drops the lines a publisher wrote above
the data (`adult`), `arff=True` skips everything down to the `@data` line of a
Weka file (`dry_bean`), `xlsx=True` reads the spreadsheet itself
(`energy_efficiency`), `inner=` opens the zip inside the zip (`student`), and
`files=` picks a different member of the one archive for each split — which
need not be train and test: `wine_quality`'s two are `red` and `white`, and
`heart_disease`'s four are the hospitals that gathered it, Cleveland, Hungary,
Switzerland and Long Beach. `codes=` may name its categories as a mapping or
just list them in order — `mushroom`'s 22 columns are the letters UCI
documents, in UCI's order, and `car_evaluation`'s six are listed worst to best,
so the numbers in the file mean what the published description says they mean.

`magic` and `htru2` are the two to point at beside `miniboone` when somebody
says HEP formats are not for machine learning: air showers in a Cherenkov
telescope, sorted into gamma rays and hadrons, and pulsar candidates from a
radio survey, sorted into pulsars and everything else. Both are ordinary
teaching sets on every benchmark list, and both go back into a ROOT file
without anybody having to adapt to us.

Converting is one pass, and `parts=` takes archives already on disk when you
would rather not download them twice:

```python
datasets.convert(
    "cifar100", "cifar100.root", split="test", parts={"archive": "cifar-100-binary.tar.gz"}
)
```

`base=` points the downloads at a mirror of your own, and `target` may be a
`WritableFile` already open, which is how several splits end up in one file:

```python
from xrdroot import create, datasets

with create("mnist.root") as out:
    for split in ("train", "test"):
        datasets.convert("mnist", out, split=split)
```

Adding a dataset of your own is an `Images`, `CIFAR`, `Audio`, `Matrix` or
`Table` in the registry — each is a frozen dataclass saying where the data is
and what its fields mean, with no code to write for the common shapes.
