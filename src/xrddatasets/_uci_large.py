"""Bounded-memory readers for large UCI teaching datasets.

The normal dataset adapters intentionally operate on bytes: that keeps their
small archive formats simple and very thoroughly checkable.  These sources
range from 0.1--37 GB and often contain another compressed archive,
so this module instead opens a cached path and consumes one member, signal
record, image, or event at a time.

Nothing here executes code from a dataset.  In particular PPG-DaLiA's NumPy
pickle is read by a restricted unpickler which permits only NumPy's inert
array constructors and built-in containers.
