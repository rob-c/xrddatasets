    ``target`` is where the file goes - a path, a URL, an open binary file, or
    a :class:`~.writer.WritableFile` already open, which is how several splits
    end up in one file. The data is downloaded from wherever the dataset is
    published unless ``parts`` supplies it: a mapping of the roles in
    :meth:`Images.urls` and its siblings to bytes, a path or a URL. ``base``
    redirects the downloads at a mirror of your own. Sources at or above the
    default two-gigabyte ceiling require ``allow_oversize=True``; this is an
    explicit storage-capacity decision and does not weaken source-size checks.
    ``progress``, when supplied, receives the number of rows written in the
    current split at bounded intervals and once more when that split finishes.

    Each tree is named for its split and its class - ``train_frog`` - with the
    split left off when the dataset has only one. Beside them goes an
    ``about`` key holding its origin, canonical licence terms and a summary of
    the transformation, so the file keeps saying where it came from and what
    was done to it.
